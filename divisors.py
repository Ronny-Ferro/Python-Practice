# Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a
# list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a
# divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number.
# For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

x = range(1, number)

for element in x:
    if number % element == 0:
